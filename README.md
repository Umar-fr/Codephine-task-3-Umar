# 3. BMI CALCULATOR
I will be developing a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Which allows users to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and visualize the result. I will enable data storage for multiple users, historical data viewing, and BMI trend analysis through statistics and graphs.
User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
-> Key Concepts and Challenges:
. BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
. Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
. GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays.
. Data Storage (for Advanced): Implement user data storage, possibly using file storage or a small database.
. Data Visualization (for Advanced): Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts.
. Error Handling (for Advanced): Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval.
. User Experience (for Advanced): Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear instructions and feedback
